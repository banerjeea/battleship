# The Classic Battleship Game

It's a .Net Core console application. Game is played on a 10 x 10 grid. You will be asked to enter your ship start position, length and orientation in-order to
add it to the board. You can then act like second user and take hits. If it's a successful hit, board would be re-printed
with hit location. Game continues till all ships are sunk. Currently it's designed for one player to act like both sides. But it's easily extensible.
